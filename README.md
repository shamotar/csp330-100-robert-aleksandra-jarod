## Project Description

Our project is a simple banking application that has the ability to withdraw, deposit, and check the balance of an account. The application will be written in a custom built language that will be compiled to Python. The language will be a simple language that will have the ability to declare variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print to the console. The language will also have the ability to define functions and call them. The language will be compiled to Python and the Python code will be executed to perform the banking operations.
